                                               Term Deposit Subscription Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at addressing the challenges faced by banking telecallers when blindly reaching out to potential customers to sell term deposit plans. The goal is to predict, with high accuracy, whether an individual will subscribe to the term deposit plan based on historical data.

## Problem Statement
Telecallers often face difficulties in identifying potential customers who are likely to subscribe to term deposit plans. This hackathon seeks to alleviate these challenges by leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict customer subscriptions based on historical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of various features related to customers, along with binary indicators of whether they subscribed to the term deposit plan or not. Participants are encouraged to explore and preprocess the data to build effective machine learning models.(https://machinehack.com/hackathons/subscriber_prediction_talent_search_hackathon/overview)

## Key Steps
1.	Data Exploration: Understand the dataset, handle missing values, and explore the distribution of the target variable.
2.	Data Preprocessing: Encode categorical variables, normalize/scale numerical features, and split the data into training and testing sets.
3.	Feature Engineering: Create new features, remove irrelevant ones, and handle outliers.
4.	Model Selection: Experiment with different classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, etc.
5.	Model Training and Evaluation: Train models and evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
